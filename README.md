Codes for Ozobot Evo

- AutonomousOzobot.js makes Ozobot Evo roll at constant speed and turn left or right to avoid obstacles. When an obstacle is detected on the left by the IR left front sensor, the left wheel speed is increased until the obstacle is no longer detected. The same approach is used if an obstacle is detected on the right.

Below an image file of the Ozoblockly code with some comments.
